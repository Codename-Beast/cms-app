# Laravel CMS (based on Laravel 11.x)
**Laravel CMS** is a Laravel 11.x based simple CMS project. Most of the commonly needed features of an application like `Authentication`, `Authorisation`, `Users` and `Role management`, `Application Backend`, `Backup`, `Log viewer` are available here. It is modular, so you may use this project as a base and build your own modules. A module can be used in any `Laravel Starter` based project.
Here Frontend and Backend are completely separated with separate routes, controllers, and themes as well.

# Custom Commands

We have created a number of custom commands for the project. The commands are listed below with a brief about their use of it.

## Create New module

To create a project use the following command, you have to replace the MODULE_NAME with the name of the module.

```php
php artisan module:build MODULE_NAME
```

You may want to use `--force` option to overwrite the existing module. if you use this option, it will replace all the existing files with the default stub files.

```php
php artisan module:build MODULE_NAME --force
```

## Clear All Cache

```bash
composer clear-all
```

this is a shortcut command to clear all cache including config, route, and more

## Code Style Fix

We are now using `Laravel Pint` to make the code style stay as clean and consistent as the Laravel Framework. Use the following command to apply CS-Fix.

```bash
composer pint
```

## Role - Permissions

Several custom commands are available to add and update `role-permissions`. Please read the [Role - Permission Wiki page](https://github.com/nasirkhan/laravel-starter/wiki/Role-Permission), where you will find the list of commands with examples.


# Features
